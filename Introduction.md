# Introduction
In today’s dynamic economic environment, understanding the key drivers of industrial property prices is critical for strategic decision-making. With evolving market forces, inflation trends, and sector-specific shifts influencing real estate values, it is vital for our business to harness data-driven insights to maintain a competitive edge. By combining **economic indicators** with **intrinsic property attributes**, we can uncover the factors that truly influence price fluctuations and better position our offerings in the market.

# Business Objective
The primary business goal of this project is twofold:

1. To gain a clear, data-backed understanding of how macroeconomic conditions and property-specific features such as area and location impact the market value of industrial properties.

2. To empower the sales and strategy teams with a reliable tool that can forecast industrial property prices based on prevailing economic conditions, thereby enhancing pricing accuracy, client advisory, and investment planning.

# Business Analytics Objective
To achieve these goals, we will conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis to quantify the relationship between economic variables and property characteristics on pricing. Subsequently, we will develop a predictive model using historical data and machine learning techniques to forecast property prices. This model will serve as a decision-support tool for pricing strategies and sales forecasting.

 ## The 3-minute story and Big Idea
 
 > Essentially, condense the 'so-what' to a paragraph and consequently, one single concise statement
 
 ### 3 minute story
 
   > If you only had three minutes to tell your audience what they need to know , what would you say?
 
 This helps to ensure you're clear on and can articulate the story you want to tell. It also prevents relying on slides/visuals for a quick brief toward stakeholders.

   <summary>Example</summary>
 
 The science department brainstormed ways to address incoming fourth-graders' negative perceptions of science. 
 They piloted a summer program for second and third graders to provide earlier science exposure and foster positive attitudes. 
 Surveys before and after the program showed a significant shift from "OK" to interested in science, with nearly 70% expressing interest afterward. 
 The department considers the pilot successful and plans to continue and expand the program.

 ### Big Idea
 
   'Big Idea' boils the 'so-what' down to a single sentence, consisting of three component:
 
    1. It must articulate your unique point of view;
    2. It must convey what's at stake; and
    3. It must be a complete sentence
